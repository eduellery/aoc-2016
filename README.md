## Introduction

### Language, Libraries and Frameworks

Language of choice: [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

* [Wikipedia - Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
* [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)

### History

I actually started Advent of Code in 2017 using Java. I decided to do the previous 2 years (2015, 2016) in Python to practice a bit and because it is the go-to language used by most of the competitive programmers that I follow. Don't get me wrong here, I'm _super slow_, but it does not prevent me from enjoying these incredibly fast programmers and watch them solve things. I'm here for the fun of it, not to win any contest. :smile:

[^disclaimer]: **Disclaimer**: I do AoC for fun and to learn new languages and new tricks. Part of my learning process (also for fun, even if I
already have experience with some language), is to check what other users do and learn things from them. I can't help but incorporate
their cool, clean, concise ideas into my code. Sometimes their code is *so* much better than mine that I end up replacing my whole code!
So I *do* come up with answers on my own, but I can't claim being the author of anything here - I'm not tracking what is mine and what I replaced. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç
